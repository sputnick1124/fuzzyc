A *very* stripped down library for fuzzy logic. This is planned to be the core of
a genetic fuzzy library, so only basic needs are supplied. Only supports triangular
mambership functions and "mean of MV" defuzzification. Emphasis is put on speed
and simple interface (though care was taken to also be correct and safe in the process).

GNU Autotools were used to create project Makefiles. Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and FreeBSD 10.4 and Mac OSX.
