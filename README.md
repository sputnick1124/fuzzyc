# FuzzyC -- A simple implementation of Fuzzy logic in C

Originally just the product of a friendly competition with a frind to develop the fastest fuzzy inference system.
It later developed into a useful tool for control optimization for simple dynamic systems in my course work (combined
with a genetic fuzzy addition). It is now mostyl a plaything, but still altogether useful. The code is mostly stable,
but changes may still occur. New features may be added, but they will be slow to appear if at all.

I should note that this project also represents my attempts to learn C, so there are many sins here. That being said,
I did take care to try to be as correct as I knew how. I may get the motivation in future months to go back and fix
many of my missteps, but I likely won't.
